# Web scraping for Wuzzuf jobs !
### Extracting Job Data in Egypt Using Web Scraping!

One of the most important skills in data analysis is data collection and cleaning. To practice this skill, I decided to do web scraping on the Wuzzuf website to gather data about Data Analyst jobs. 🕵️‍♂️

### What did I do?
🔹 I used BeautifulSoup to extract the data.
🔹 I collected information about job titles, companies, locations, and the time the job was posted.
🔹 I cleaned the data and saved it in an Excel file for easy analysis.

### The challenge I faced:
I discovered that the website displays jobs across multiple pages. That pushed me to search and learn how to handle pagination — and after several tries, I finally managed to collect the data successfully!

### What did I gain from this?
✔ A deeper understanding of the job market requirements for data analysis roles.

✔ Improved my skills in web scraping and data cleaning.

✔ Prepared a real-world dataset that can be analyzed and used to extract insights.
